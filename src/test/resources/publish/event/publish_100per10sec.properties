# By specifying its value framework gets to know that how many times the test(s), i.e. the number of requests will be
# repeated per every 'ramp.up.period.in.seconds'.
# Supposing number.of.threads = x, ramp.up.period.in.seconds = y, loop.count = i
# then (x * i) = number of requests will be fired over (y * i) seconds. If x=5, i=3, y=20, then 15 requests will be
# fired in 60 seconds which means- every request in 4 seconds gap. 60/15 or 20/5 = 4seconds.
